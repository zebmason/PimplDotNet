# PimplDotNet

This repository contains C# source code, translation to C++/CLI and slides for my Lightning Talk entitled "Pimp(l) your .NET code" for the DotNetSheff Meetup on 4th June 2019.

The reason to translate the C# code in the manner shown is to defeat decompilation using JetBrains dotPeek.
